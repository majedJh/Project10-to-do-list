## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Used my small self-built CSS library
- JS
- JS Intersection Observer

### What I learned

For me I consider this project as the best and most organized one. Used regex, set data structure, intersection observer, lazyload idea for loading small batches of the total to-dos saved in the local storage, window match media for applying the OS preferd color theme using "prefered-color-scheme" media query, and drag-and-drop list items, all in order to actually code what I had in mind since i started this project. I think this is the most readable and reuseable code for a project I've ever done.  

### Continued development

I should learn how to focus more on accessability, implementing ARIA in the HTML, JS.
